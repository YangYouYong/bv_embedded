On Linux

Depending on which version of libusb you have access to you'll need to modify
the makefile in this directory accordingly

If you have access to the latest libusb, libusb-1.0, you can install it on
Debian or equivalent:

apt-get install libusb-1.0-0
apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev 


To use the earlier version of libusb, libusb-0.1, do the following

apt-get install libusb
apt-get install libusb-dev 


To run the code

Ensure that band code is on the bioband (the usual openocd and make flash)

then try running one of the options ...

./mrc -bb


Note that if the cwa device is not found ..

- check that you saw the blue led flash as you plugged the device onto the
  breakout board (or handylink cable) correctly. Is the connector flush with the
  device?
  
- do you have a udev rule that gives user permission to access this device. A
  temporary check is to try 'sudo ./mrc -bb', supply the superuser
  password, and see if the device is then found.
  
- if the device is found with sudo then it's a permissions problem. Check the
  permissions of 'usb_device' devtype in /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules,
  if the file exists, then change it so it reads
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", MODE="0666"

- alternatively if 50-udev-default.rules does not exist, check for any other
  rules setting the permissions of ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device". If none exist
  then you will need to set up your own udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d in an
  appropriately named file with the rule given above. For any udev problems
  refer to Google with search terms 'linux udev usb_device'.


For all the options do
./mrc ?
