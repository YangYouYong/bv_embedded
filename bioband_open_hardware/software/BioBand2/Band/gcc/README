To build, ensure that you have created the cortex cross compile toolchain and
that you have it (something like /usr/local/cross-cortex-m3/bin) and the scripts
directory on your path.

Then do make and make flash.

The flashing code assumes the use of openocd and amontec JTAG dongle.




For toolchain details see http://sourceforge.net/p/bioband/home/Toolchain/
or the docs/Bioband_flashing_and_PC_setup_guide.pdf
