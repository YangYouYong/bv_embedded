This directory holds both the BioBand firmware and Linux PC side software.

To compile the firmware you will need the cortex cross compile toolchain and to
have that and the openocd flashing scripts in your path, see README file in
BioBand2/Band/gcc 

The band firmware uses the 3rd party CMSIS and STM32 libraries, which are
copyright of ARM and ST Micro, respectively.

The Libraries are supplied here to ensure compilation due to a couple of minor
changes made to the libraries for the BioBand project. The libraries are not the
current versions and no warranty is implied. Please see the individual libraries
for licensing terms.

The firmware uses the STM standard peripheral and USB libraries to provide the
support functionality for numerous areas, namely: the backup domain (bkp),
analogue to digital conversion (adc), general purpose I/O (gpio), realtime time
clock (rtc), clock crystal (rcc), power modes (pwr), serial peripheral
interface (spi), serial interface (usart) and nested vector interrupt handling
(misc). This simplifies access to these major components, easing the design of
the firmware.
