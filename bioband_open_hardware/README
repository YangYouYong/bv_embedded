The BioBand is an open hardware lightweight battery efficient design based on
the STMicro STM32F103 processor.

The processor is an inexpensive, low density ARM Cortex-M3 core based device,
manufactured by ST Micro. The enclosed Cortex-M3 core provides a standardized
microcontroller which goes beyond the classical CPU to provide the entire heart
of a microcontroller (including the interrupt system, 24-bit timer and memory
map). 

Hardware design: Chris Jones
Firmware: Jim Rayner

The small size of the design, low power usage and simple firmware creation make
this hardware platform ideal for small scale fast prototyping of niche battery
efficient mobile devices.

The hardware/software has been forked here to re-add missing firmware files.

The project was for a continuous waveform accelerometer, intended for assessing
physical activity of human participants during daily life conditions.

The project was initiated in 2009 by the Medical Research Council's Epidemiology
Unit (Cambridge, UK) in partnership with UK Biobank to explore its potential for
assessing physical activity in large-scale epidemiological studies.

The development squad (DevSquad) was led by Dr Soren Brage (MEU) and included
the following members:
Vincent van Hees
Marcelo Pias
Salman Taherian
Michael Catt
Chris Jones (electronics consultant)
Jim Rayner (firmware/software)
Kishen Gohil (Product Design consultant)

Several routes were explored before deciding on the design, which was then
tested repeatedly on the bench and during field conditions.

The results at the end of the design:
The accelerometer consistently records 50Hz triaxial acceleration data and
~0.25Hz temperature data on a single charge for 7+ days during bench testing.
This is achieved, even when the device is put in standby state for 5 days
prior (to simulate remote initialisation of monitor, mail-out to participant,
followed by 7 days of human data collection).

During real-life conditions, however, data collection is sometimes interrupted
before the programmed end of collection for yet unknown reasons.

We can achieve successful data collection in the field if we seal the connector
(with silicone-based bathroom sealant), so our suspicion is that there is some
vulnerability of the connector.
